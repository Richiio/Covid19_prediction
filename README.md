# Covid19_prediction
This repository contains a research work I performed at Dr.Olukoya's Research Lab
<h3>Problem</h3>
Predicting the severity of COVID-19 in patients. Given the dataset, my task was to build a model that accurately predicts whether a patient has COVID-19 or not

<h3>Application</h3>
I built a frontend application with react and styled with tailwindcss where a user gets to fill in common signs such as Fever, etc based on a scale of 1-10 and the model predicts the severity of the virus in the patient. 
React source file is in the Predict folder.
I used firebase to handle some basic backend functionalities

<h3>Re-do</h3>
If I'm to come back to this project, I would create the front-end with nextjs and styled components.
